# Contributor Covenant Code of Conduct

## The Golden Rule

Since we're going back in time anyways, ask yourself what your kindergarten teacher would say about treating others the way you'd like to be treated. We all started somewhere, and these people were brave enough to upload their humble beginnings to a public GitHub repository. If you don't want to the same, that's perfectly fine — but don't rain on anyone's parade simply because they're proud of how far they've come since they started.

## Other Rules

Examples of behavior that contributes to creating a positive environment
include:

* Using welcoming and inclusive language
* Being respectful of differing viewpoints and experiences
* Gracefully accepting constructive criticism
* Focusing on what is best for the community
* Showing empathy towards other community members

Examples of unacceptable behavior by participants include:

* The use of sexualized language or imagery and unwelcome sexual attention or
  advances
* Trolling, insulting/derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks
* Public or private harassment
* Publishing others' private information, such as a physical or electronic
  address, without explicit permission
* Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a
  professional setting

## Reporting Misconduct or General Feedback

In the interest of a welcoming community, if you'd like to privately send feedback or information to me regarding this repository, you're welcome to send me a direct email at <jake@jarv.is>. Or, the issues and pull requests sections are completely open to anyone who wants to comment and/or contribute.

If you're included here and didn't add yourself, it's because I did a quick search for public repositories with queries like "my first website" and "first project 1999." Feel free to [remove yourself](https://github.com/jakejarvis/awesome-first-code/edit/master/readme.md) via a pull request or issue (or send me a direct email) if you don't wish to be listed and I'll accept it immediately. (But I beg you not to do this purely out of embarrassment — the purpose of this list is to be proud of how far you've come since then!)
